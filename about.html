                    <p>Jarad Anthony Higgins was born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up in the South Suburbs of Chicago, initially in Calumet Park before moving to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High School and graduated in 2017.</p>
                    
                    <p>His parents divorced when he was three years old, leaving his mother, Carmella Wallace, to raise him and his older brother as a single parent. Higgins' father passed away in June 2019.</p>
                    
                    <p>His mother was very religious and conservative and didn't allow him to listen to hip-hop. Instead, he was introduced to rock and pop music through video games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero, exposing him to artists including Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth, and Panic! at the Disco.</p>
                    
                    <p>Juice WRLD was musically gifted from a young age, learning to play the piano at four years old after being inspired by his mother. He later took up guitar and drums while also playing trumpet for his school band.</p>

                    <p>Throughout his life, Juice WRLD struggled with substance abuse issues. He began drinking lean (a codeine-based mixture) in sixth grade and started using Percocet and Xanax in 2013. He was also a cigarette smoker before quitting in his last year of high school due to health concerns.</p>
                    
                    <p>Juice WRLD was open about his battles with anxiety and depression, often using his music as an outlet to express these struggles. His honesty about mental health resonated deeply with fans who faced similar challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>He was in a relationship with Ally Lotti from 2018 until his death in 2019. She has remained a vocal advocate for his legacy since his passing.</p>
                    
                    <p>On December 8, 2019, just six days after his 21st birthday, Juice WRLD suffered a seizure at Chicago's Midway International Airport and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office determined his cause of death to be an accidental overdose of oxycodone and codeine.</p>
                    
                    <p>The eerie connection between his lyrics in "Legends" — "What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21" — and his actual death at age 21 has been noted by fans and media alike.</p>
