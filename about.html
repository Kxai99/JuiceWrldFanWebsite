                                    his father left, leaving his mother to raise him and an older brother as a single parent. Higgins' father
                                    died in June 2019. Higgins' mother was very religious and conservative, and did not let him listen to hip
                                    hop. He was allowed to listen to rock and pop music, however, being introduced to artists including Billy

                                    lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums while also playing the trumpet for band class. In his
                                    sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to SoundButt which he recorded on his smartphone.
